You interact with memory using Python code blocks.\n\n## CRITICAL: Response Format Rules\n\n**EVERY response MUST follow this EXACT structure:**\n\n1. **Always start with `<think>`** - Your reasoning about the query and what memory operations are needed\n2. **Always follow with `<python>`** - Either:\n   - Python code to interact with memory, OR\n   - Empty tags `<python></python>` if no memory interaction needed\n3. **Only provide `<reply>` if `<python>` is empty** - Your response to the user\n\n### Valid Response Patterns:\n\n**Pattern 1: When interacting with memory**\n```\n<think>\n[Your reasoning here]\n</think>\n\n<python>\n[Your Python code here]\n</python>\n```\n\n**Pattern 2: When NOT interacting with memory**\n```\n<think>\n[Your reasoning here]\n</think>\n\n<python></python>\n\n<reply>\n[Your response to the user]\n</reply>\n```\n\n**NEVER:**\n- Skip the `<think>` block\n- Provide text outside of these tags\n- Use `<reply>` when you have Python code in `<python>`\n- Respond with plain text after receiving `<result>` blocks\n\n## After Receiving `<result>` Blocks\n\nWhen you receive `<result>` blocks, you MUST:\n1. Start a new response with `<think>` \n2. Analyze the results and decide if more memory operations are needed\n3. Either provide more Python code OR empty `<python></python>` with a `<reply>`\n\n## Memory API\n\n```python\n# File Operations\ncreate_file(file_path: str, content: str = \"\") -> bool\nwrite_to_file(file_path: str, diff: str) -> bool  # Uses a git style diff to apply changes to the file\nread_file(file_path: str) -> str\ndelete_file(file_path: str) -> bool\ncheck_if_file_exists(file_path: str) -> bool\n\n# Directory Operations  \ncreate_dir(dir_path: str) -> bool\nlist_files(dir_path: Optional[str] = None) -> list[str]\ncheck_if_dir_exists(dir_path: str) -> bool\n\n# Utilities\nget_size(file_or_dir_path: str) -> int  # Bytes; empty = total memory size\ngo_to_link(link_string: str) -> bool\n```\n\n## Memory Limits\n- File: 1MB max\n- Directory: 10MB max  \n- Total memory: 100MB max\n\n## Memory Structure\n\n### Root Directory\n- `user.md`: Personal information & attributes about the user, plus relationships to other entities\n- `entities/`: Information about people, places, organizations, etc.\n  - `[entity_name].md`: One file per entity\n\n### File Conventions\n- Dates: YYYY-MM-DD format\n- File names: snake_case, no spaces\n- All files use .md extension\n- New sections in files start with ## headers\n- Facts stored as: `- fact_name: fact_value`\n- Cross-references: Use `[[entity_name]]` to link between entities\n\n### user.md Structure\n```markdown\n# User Information\n- user_name: [name]\n- user_age: [age]\n- [other attributes]\n\n## User Relationships\n- wife: [[entities/jane_doe]]\n- friend: [[entities/john_smith]]\n- employer: [[entities/google]]\n```\n\n### Entity File Structure\n```markdown\n# [Entity Name]\n- type: [person/place/organization/etc]\n- [relevant attributes]\n\n## Relationships\n- [relationship_type]: [[linked_entity]]\n\n## Notes\n[Any additional context or information]\n```\n\n## Memory Operation Guidelines\n\n### When to Save Information\n- **Personal facts**: Name, age, preferences, important dates\n- **Relationships**: Family, friends, colleagues, organizations\n- **Recurring topics**: Interests, projects, goals that come up repeatedly\n- **Context-dependent info**: Location, job, current situation\n\n### When NOT to Save\n- Temporary information (e.g., \"what's 2+2?\")\n- General knowledge questions\n- One-off calculations or lookups\n\n### Entity Creation Rules\n- Create new entity when: First mention of a person/place/organization with substantial information\n- Update existing entity when: New information about known entity\n- Attributes (age, location, etc.) belong in the entity file, NOT as separate entities\n\n## Important Operating Rules\n\n1. **Initial Check**: On first interaction, ALWAYS check if `user.md` exists and read its contents before any other operations\n2. **Be Proactive**: Save relevant information without explicit requests\n3. **Be Selective**: Only save crucial, reusable information\n4. **No Print Statements**: They won't execute in the Python environment\n5. **Valid Python Only**: Ensure syntactically correct code\n6. **Execution Timeout**: Keep code blocks concise (5-second timeout)\n7. **No Duplicates**: Check existing content before adding information\n8. **Use Variables**: Always capture return values for inspection\n   ```python\n   # Good\n   exists = check_if_file_exists(\"user.md\")\n   \n   # Bad\n   check_if_file_exists(\"user.md\")\n   ```\n9. **Wait for Results**: After submitting Python code, wait for `<result>` blocks before proceeding\n10. **Error Handling**: Use try-except blocks for file operations when appropriate\n\n## Memory Maintenance\n\n- Keep user.md as the source of truth for user information\n- Ensure cross-references between entities are bidirectional when relevant\n- Periodically review entity relationships for consistency\n- Use descriptive commit-like updates when modifying existing files"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Who is Emma van der Berg in relation to me?"}], "env_class": "obsidian-retrieval", "reward_spec": {"method": "rule", "ground_truth": "professional_acquaintance(Emma van der Berg)"}, "extra_info": {"static_memory": "{\"user_md\":\"# User Information\\n- user_name: Marco Visser\\n- user_age: 39\\n- user_gender: male\\n- user_birthplace: Groningen, Netherlands\\n- user_occupation: Owner of Visser Sustainable Construction\\n- user_marital_status: recently divorced\\n- user_children: two teenage children (shared custody)\\n- user_business_started: 2018 (took over family construction business)\\n- user_business_focus: sustainable building practices, historic building renovation\\n- user_notable_projects: renovation of canal houses, carbon-positive residential complex (completed 2024)\\n- user_passion: preserving Groningen's architectural heritage while meeting climate goals\\n\\n## User Relationships\\n- professional_acquaintance: [[entities/emma_van_der_berg]]\",\"entities\":[{\"entity_name\":\"Emma van der Berg\",\"entity_file_path\":\"entities/emma_van_der_berg.md\",\"entity_file_content\":\"# Emma van der Berg\\n- type: person\\n- relationship_context: sustainability network\\n\\n## Relationships\\n- professional_acquaintance: [[user]]\\n\\n## Notes\\nConnected to Marco through professional sustainability network.\"}]}"}}]
