In Berlin, she opened 'Neue Perspektiven,' a contemporary art gallery in Mitte that focuses on Eastern European and refugee artists. The gallery has become a cultural bridge, showcasing works that explore themes of displacement, identity, and belonging. Sofia has been instrumental in providing platform opportunities for artists like Amira and has developed a reputation for discovering emerging talent. She speaks five languages fluently and has become a key figure in Berlin's international art scene. Sofia struggles with feelings of cultural displacement but finds purpose in creating spaces for artistic expression and cross-cultural dialogue.\\n\\n## Relationships\\n- **Aleksandr Petrov** - Husband\\n- **Amira Al-Hassan** -
