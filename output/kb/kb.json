        "detailed_backstory": "Priya moved to Berlin in 2019 after completing her PhD in data science at IIT Mumbai, attracted by opportunities in Germany's growing tech sector and progressive policies around work-life balance. She was recruited by BVG (Berlin's public transportation authority) to work on optimizing bus and train schedules using machine learning and passenger flow analysis. Priya's work has become particularly important as Berlin adapts its transportation infrastructure for post-pandemic usage patterns and climate goals. She met Michael through a mutual friend at an art opening in 2023, and their relationship represents the intersection of Berlin's tech and cultural communities. Priya lives in Tempelhof-Schöneberg and is passionate about how data science can be used to create more equitable urban systems.",
