Inspired by the communal and creative spirit of post-reunification Berlin but dismayed by accelerating gentrification, she founded 'KiezKonnekt', a co-working and community space in Neukölln. Her mission is to provide an affordable hub for freelancers, artists, and local initiatives. She's passionate and a natural leader but struggles with the financial pressures of the business and the emotional toll of fighting what feels like a losing battle against corporate development. She has recently started seeing a therapist to cope with burnout.",

He loves his sister but has a complicated mix of pride and envy regarding her success with KiezKonnekt, which he views as both a genuine community effort and a symbol of the 'new Berlin' that is pushing out artists like him.
