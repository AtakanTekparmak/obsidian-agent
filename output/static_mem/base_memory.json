Inspired by the communal and creative spirit of post-reunification Berlin but dismayed by accelerating gentrification, she founded 'KiezKonnekt', a co-working and community space in Neuk\u00f6lln. Her mission is to provide an affordable hub for freelancers, artists, and local initiatives. She's passionate and a natural leader but struggles with the financial pressures of the business and the emotional toll of fighting what feels like a losing battle against corporate development. She has recently started seeing a therapist to cope with burnout.\n\n## User Relationships\n- brother: [[entities/lukas_schmidt.md]]\n- business_partner: [[entities/cem_yilmaz.md]]\n- ex-boyfriend: [[entities/david_chen.md]]\n- mentor: [[entities/anja_weber.md]]\n- tenant/member_of_her_space: [[entities/elena_petrova.md]]\n- therapist: [[entities/dr_sofia_costa.md]]", "entities": [{"entity_name": "Lukas Schmidt", "entity_file_path": "entities/lukas_schmidt.md", "entity_file_content": "# Lukas Schmidt\n- age: 29\n- gender: male\n- occupation: Musician / Bartender\n- birthplace: Berlin, Germany\n\n## Backstory\nKlara's younger brother, Lukas, is the archetypal struggling artist.

He loves his sister but has a complicated mix of pride and envy regarding her success with KiezKonnekt, which he views as both a genuine community effort and a symbol of the 'new Berlin' that is pushing out artists like him.
