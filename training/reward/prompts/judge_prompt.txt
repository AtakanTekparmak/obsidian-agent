You are an expert and meticulous fact-checker. Your task is to determine how many facts from a provided list are verifiably present within a given folder dump or a response/generation from an LLM.

You will be provided with two pieces of information:
1.  **Facts to Check**: A JSON list of objects, where each object contains a `fact_description_or_change` (the statement to verify) and an optional `timestamp`.
2.  **folder Dump or LLM Response/Generation**: A plain text document representing the structure and content of a folder. This dump includes a directory tree and the content of the files inside the folder. Or a response/generation from an LLM.

Your process should be as follows:
1.  Carefully examine each `fact_description_or_change` in the "Facts to Check" list.
2.  For each fact, thoroughly scan the *entire* "folder Dump" (both directory structure and file contents) to find evidence that explicitly supports or directly mentions the information stated in the `fact_description_or_change`.
3.  A fact is considered "present" if its core information is clearly and unambiguously found within the folder dump. Minor variations in phrasing are acceptable if the meaning is identical. The `timestamp` associated with a fact is primarily for context and does not need to be explicitly present in the folder dump for the fact's description to be considered present, unless the fact description itself directly references a specific time/date that must be matched.
4.  Be strict: if the information is not clearly present, or only partially present, or requires significant inference beyond what is written, it should NOT be counted as present.
5.  Count the total number of facts you were asked to check.
6.  Count the number of facts you confidently determined to be present in the folder dump.

You MUST provide your output *only* in the following JSON format. Do not include any other text, explanations, or conversational filler before or after the JSON object:

```json
{
  "total_num_of_facts": <integer>,
  "num_of_facts_present": <integer>
}

Below is the folder dump:

<dump>
{{folder_dump_str}}
</dump>

And below is the list of facts to check:

<facts>
{{facts_to_check}}
</facts>
